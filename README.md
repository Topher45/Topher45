- 👋 Hi, I’m @Topher45
- 👀 I’m interested in writing and editing code. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the many different languages, their functions, and how I can use them to productively monitor, protect, and prevent damage to my systems and devices, as well as protecting the rights and truths of others whom may need a helping hand from a good and honest person.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on systems recovery and remediation, internet security and systems maintenance, as well as malware/virus prevention and removal tactics.
- 📫 How to reach me, just leave me a brief message and the nature of your questions.
-Thank you and happy coding, folks!
